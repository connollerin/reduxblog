# CS52 HW5 Pt 2- Blog Authentication

For this assignemnt, we added authentication through the back-end and front-end so that users can only edit and add new posts if they are signed in. Their names, which are saved when signing up, are associated with whichever posts have been most recently created or edited by them.

I think saving the name was the most challenging for me navigating through all the back and front end files, but I think it works well now. If I had more time, I would make it smoother when an unauthorized error is thrown. I would want to connect that through the front end. For now, I just have a static warning on the edit part of the page.
