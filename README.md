# js-starter with react react-router babel sass and eslint

For this project, I have used redux's structure of store, actions and reducers to implement a blog. The main page along with the individual view of a post and the edit view of a post are implemented as connected components which can get information and keep updated from the data stored with our api.Â 

I think the connections work well, and I found it helpful to implement a component for each individual post listed on the main page.

For extra credit, I have added some css to make it look better.
